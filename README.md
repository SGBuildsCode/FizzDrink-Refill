# FizzDrink-Refill
Working in Python, this repository includes with it the source code for a program which simulates a real world scenario wherein a person 
enters a restaurant or a cold refreshments bar and is asked which drink they would like. 
Additionally, through the use of a while loop construct along with an if statement, 
the user can (if they so wish) request for another drink continuously until they indicate otherwise at which point the program will terminate.
